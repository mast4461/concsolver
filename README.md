A small program for solving an equation describing enzyme concentrations in a certain bio chemistry experiment.

The purpose of the program is to calculate solutions to the equation that can then be used to figure out which concentrations to use in the experiment so as to optimize the predicted quality of the experiment results.

The program is developed for [Jerry St√•lberg](http://www.slu.se/en/about-slu/contact-slu/search/search-employee/person-presentation/?emp=BBFB7557172BD4E19D9F734A050512F2).
